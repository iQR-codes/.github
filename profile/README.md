## ‚ùì What is iQR codes?

**iQR codes** is a professional **QR code studio for macOS** that focuses on *precision, branding, and reliability*. It generates standards-compliant QR codes for URLs, Wi-Fi, vCards, events, emails, crypto addresses, app deep links, payment payloads, and more. Unlike web generators that compress or blur output, iQR codes renders **pixel-perfect vectors** at any size‚Äîready for print, packaging, signage, or high-DPI screens.

At the heart of iQR codes is **data integrity**. The app validates payloads, chooses the right error-correction level (L/M/Q/H), and warns you when artwork or logos risk readability. With **live verification** you can test codes instantly‚Äîon-screen or with your webcam‚Äîbefore they ever leave your Mac, preventing expensive misprints and support headaches.

Brand teams love the **design system**: rounded or squared modules, quiet-zone control, colored foregrounds and backgrounds, gradients, branded finder patterns, and **safe logo overlays** with auto-resize. All styling remains within ISO/IEC 18004 limits, so the code still scans reliably in harsh conditions (low light, glare, distance, or damaged surfaces).

For scale, iQR codes includes a **batch generator**. Import CSV/Numbers sheets (e.g., unique coupon URLs, staff vCards, seat IDs), map columns to templates, and export **hundreds or thousands** of QR codes in a single pass with consistent naming rules. The app can output multiple formats at once‚Äî**SVG/PDF** for vector print, **PNG** for web, **EPS** for legacy workflows‚Äîplus optional captions or bleed.

Security and longevity are prioritized. You can create **privacy-friendly static codes** that don‚Äôt rely on tracking services, or **dynamic codes** that redirect through your own links for future updates. Built-in best-practice tips help you pick short, canonical URLs, ensure HTTPS, and avoid payloads that leak personal data. All generation happens **locally** on your Mac.

Finally, iQR codes fits real teams: reusable **templates**, color presets, export recipes, and file-naming tokens make handoff effortless for design, print, and dev. Whether you‚Äôre labeling inventory, publishing menus, onboarding customers to Wi-Fi, or shipping a national campaign, iQR codes turns raw data into **beautiful, scannable, and brand-safe** QR assets‚Äîfast.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About iQR codes (Expanded)

iQR codes was built to solve three persistent problems with QR creation: **unreliable scans**, **off-brand visuals**, and **painful batch work**. The app‚Äôs engine computes **module size** and **quiet zone** requirements from your chosen physical print size, preventing the common mistake of squeezing too much data into a tiny square. Error-correction and mask selection are auto-optimized but can be overridden for special cases, and the simulator shows how the code behaves with glare, blur, or partial damage.

On the design side, the editor treats QR as a first-class graphic: align it to grids, snap to guides, apply gradients within safe contrast ranges, and customize finder/alignment eyes without breaking decodability. You can drop a **center logo**; the app calculates a safe overlay area based on ECC and data density, then suggests the right reduction to maintain high scan rates. Export profiles ensure **PDF/SVG** include clean vector paths (no rasterization) for razor-sharp presses.

For operations teams, the **batch module** is the hero. Map columns from CSV (e.g., `name,url,filename`) to dynamic labels and file names; add frame/caption templates with variables; generate multi-format outputs per row; and keep a **manifest** for traceability. Shops printing stickers or ID cards can push **thousands of codes per job** with consistent positioning and bleed, eliminating manual re-layout.

The scanner/inspector helps QA and support: import a client‚Äôs QR from a photo or PDF, view its decoded payload, and run a **contrast/quiet zone audit** to explain why a code fails in the wild. For developers, deep-link templates and `app-clip`/`universal link` helpers reduce trial-and-error. For privacy teams, the app encourages **static codes** where appropriate and documents the tradeoffs of dynamic tracking.

Because it‚Äôs **Mac-native**, iQR codes is fast on Apple Silicon, supports drag-and-drop throughout, and plays nicely with design tools (Affinity, Illustrator, Sketch, Figma) and office apps. Templates, colors, and export presets can be stored in a shared folder for team consistency. Everything runs offline; nothing is uploaded unless you choose to.
